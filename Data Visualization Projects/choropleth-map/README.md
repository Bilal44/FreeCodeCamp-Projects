# Visualize Data with a Choropleth Map

<b>User Story #1:</b> My choropleth should have a title with a corresponding id="title".

<b>User Story #2:</b> My choropleth should have a description element with a corresponding id="description".

<b>User Story #3:</b> My choropleth should have counties with a corresponding class="county" that represent the data.

<b>User Story #4:</b> There should be at least 4 different fill colors used for the counties.

<b>User Story #5:</b> My counties should each have data-fips and data-education properties containing their corresponding fips and education values.

<b>User Story #6:</b> My choropleth should have a county for each provided data point.

<b>User Story #7:</b> The counties should have data-fips and data-education values that match the sample data.

<b>User Story #8:</b> My choropleth should have a legend with a corresponding id="legend".

<b>User Story #9:</b> There should be at least 4 different fill colors used for the legend.

<b>User Story #10:</b> I can mouse over an area and see a tooltip with a corresponding id="tooltip" which displays more information about the area.

<b>User Story #11:</b> My tooltip should have a data-education property that corresponds to the data-education of the active area.
